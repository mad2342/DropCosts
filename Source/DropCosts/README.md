# DropCosts

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Makes you pay operational costs for mission drops.

## Gameplay changes
* You have a limited amount of tonnage available that you can drop without further cost
    * Depends on contracts difficult rating and if the mission is a priority (campaign) mission
* Going above that limit will cost you a configurable amount of C-Bills/Ton
